<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Description
delivery-or-nah is a mobile app integrated with iOS that empowers users to compare prices between popular delivery services such as Instacart, Shipt, Uber Eats, DoorDash, GrubHub, GoPuff, and more, with the actual establishment prices. 

The app allows users to export their cart from these delivery services before order submission, saving the item names and the total cost, including taxes, delivery fees, and tip. 

It then fetches the prices for the same items directly from the respective establishments and calculates the total price, giving users the option to make an informed decision on whether to proceed with the delivery service or purchase directly from the establishment.

## Basic Workflow
1. Cart Data Retrieval: Implement APIs to fetch cart data from popular delivery services (Instacart, Shipt, Uber Eats, etc.).
2. Price Calculation: Use the fetched cart data to calculate the total cost, including taxes, delivery fees, and tips for the delivery services.
3. Establishment Price Retrieval: Implement APIs to retrieve prices for the same items directly from the respective establishments.
4. Total Price Comparison: Compare the total price for the delivery service with the total price for purchasing directly from the establishment.
5. User Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface to present the comparison results to users.
6. Real-Time Data Updates: Ensure that the app updates prices in real-time to reflect any changes in the delivery service or establishment prices.

## Basic I/O Details
delivery-or-nah will be a mobile app available on iOS devices. Users can export their cart data from popular delivery services using the app's built-in functionality. The app will display the item names, prices, taxes, delivery fees, and tips for the delivery service. It will then fetch and display the prices from the respective establishments for comparison. Users can make a decision based on the presented information.
